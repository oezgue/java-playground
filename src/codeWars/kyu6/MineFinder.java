//You've just discovered a square (NxN) field and you notice a warning sign. The sign states that there's a single bomb in the 2D grid-like field in front of you.
//
//Write a function that accepts a 2D array, and returns the location of the mine. The mine is represented as the integer 1 in the 2D array. Areas in the 2D array that are not the mine will be represented as 0s.
//
//The location returned should be an array (Tuple<int, int> in C#, RAX:RDX in NASM, std::pair<std::size_t, std::size_t> in C++) where the first element is the row index, and the second element is the column index of the bomb location (both should be 0 based). All 2D arrays passed into your function will be a square (NxN), and there will only be one mine in the array.
//Examples (Input --> Output)
//
//[ [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] ] --> [0, 0]
//
//        [ [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0] ] --> [1, 1]
//
//        [ [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0] ] --> [2, 1]
//
